# Sorting_Visualizers
This project aims to visualize various sorting algorithms and to demonstrate the live working of how actually sorting happened.
Fascinated by sorting algorithms and their humongous part in almost every software that is written, I have come up with a Sorting Visualizer that enables a newbie to understand the full functionality of a sorting algorithm.

An integer array that keeps manipulating one step a time dictated as per user convenience is a major highlight.
A static website for visualizing different comparison based sorting algorithms can be obsererved :https://sorting-visualizer-psi.vercel.app/

Feature are mentioned below:

•Sorting Visualising

•Algorithm selection

•Algorithm tweaking & rewriting

•Adjustable size

•Custom array input
